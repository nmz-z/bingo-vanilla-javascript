Hi, I'm Diego (nmz-z in GitHub) and this project is builded 100% for me, enjoy it! =).

--- HOW TO RUN ---

This is a vanilla JavaScript project that uses modules, so probably you need to use some extension or complement in your IDE, like "live server" in Visual Studio Code to run the project without errors if you want to run it on your localhost.
